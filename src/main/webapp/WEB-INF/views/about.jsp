                    <p class="lead">
                        George Spiliakos, Stelios Papadopoulos and Aris Markopouliotis embarked on their wine-making career 
                        with no land and no gear, leasing vineyards and renting winery equipment from other 
                        wine producers in Nemea and using manual bottling machines. Nevertheless, even at that point, 
                        their one and only aspiration was high quality wine production.</p>

                        Our vineyards have the full care and attention 
                        from our specialist team, in order to produce juices full of aroma and taste. 
                        The first vineyard, planted with the replanting of 2012, our malagousia, is situated in
                        Nemea, symbolizing our present, rooted firmly in our history. Our facilities and 
                        procedures ensure the right vinification and maturation, while our bottles, after consumption, 
                        are recycled, as early as 2014.
